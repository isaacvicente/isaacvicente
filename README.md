Hi, I'm Isaac! I'm a relatively curious person and I (almost) always ask myself the whys of things. I try to understand the things around me and how they affect me.

As a self-taught person, I learned to like a lot of things I didn't like, like history, philosophy, mathematics, sociology, physics, and many other things.
Although I like all these things, math has a special place in my heart.

I was born in Brazil in a northeast little city called Currais Novos. Currently I see myself as a beginner in this immense world of computing. I study at the Federal University of Campina Grande, in the [Computer Science course](https://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/).

I started to get interested in technology and programming in the year 2020, and, after a period of indecision about which career to pursue, I was sure I wouldn't see myself working except in front of a computer. Since then I have been increasingly interested in open source philosophy and Linux.

### Areas of interest
- Math, physics and problem-solving in general.
- Literature.
- Human history, anthropology, sociology, philosophy and social politics.
